    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Collaboration <span class="muted">At Every Step</span></h2>
    <p class="lead"><b><i>VISION</i></b> is the only development tool that allows developers, designers, product owners, entrepreneurs and their customers to continually collaborate with each other at every step within the development process.</p>
    <p class="lead">Collaboration takes place within <b><i>VISION</i></b> where everyone can work together seamlessly. This seamless collaboration is possible because the VISION platform is always running live. There is no more waiting on others to compile, debug, fix and rebuild because there is no code.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Design and Develop </h2>
    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Within <i>VISION</i></h2>
    <p class="lead">In current approaches to software development, a team storyboards a software solution using design tools. Then, it is off to a different set of tools where developers code out the idea. Finally, the team regroups to see the efforts of the developers.</p>
	  <p class="lead">While this is a great and effective tool to keep people focused and on track, why not remove a few steps?  With <b><i>VISION</i></b>, not only can you have this same type of collaboration, but as you build out your storyboard, you are building the software solution and seeing it run instantly: all within the same tool.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Development Process</h2>
    <p class="lead"><b><i>VISION</i></b> means you no longer have to code, verify syntax, compile, debug, document, wash, rinse and repeat.</p>
    <p class="lead">Every step of the development process in <b><i>VISION</i></b>, from design to implementation to distribution, is done by connecting parts together.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">No More </h2>
    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Re-inventing the Wheel</h2>
    <p class="lead">As you build out your software solutions in <b><i>VISION</i></b>, it only gets easier. The parts of your software that you have created can be turned into templates which can be re-used. There is no longer a need to re-invent the same things over and over again!</p>
    <p class="lead">With <b><i>VISION</i></b>, we have written an awesome framework which allows you to focus on your solutions and not our development platform.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Education <span class="muted">Made Easier</span></h2>
    <p class="lead"><b><i>VISION</i></b> is very easy to learn. Our GUI-based Visual Development Platform enables users to learn how to think and work like great developers, allowing them to build any software they can imagine.</p>
    <p class="lead">Interface Vision is dedicated to making software education available to everyone: especially young adults. As such, we have created <a href="http://www.innovisioneducation.com" target="_blank">The Innovision Education Group</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">IT Education </h2>
    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">For Everyone</h2>
    <p class="lead">Learning to write software is really hard because students need to learn how to solve problems using a "programming mindset" and learn the idiosyncratic syntax that is coding at the same time. <b><i>VISION</i></b> solves this problem by allowing students to learn how to think like a programmer without having to learn how to code. This allows the student to focus on problem solving without having to learn the variations of programming languages and compilers.</p>
