    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Within <i>VISION</i></h2>
    <p class="lead">In current approaches to software development, a team storyboards a software solution using design tools. Then, it is off to a different set of tools where developers code out the idea. Finally, they team regroups to see the efforts of the developers.</p>
	  <p class="lead">While this is a great and effective tool to keep people focused and on track, why not remove a few steps?  With <b><i>VISION</i></b>, not only can you have this same type of collaboration, but as you build out your storyboard, you are building the software solution and seeing it run instantly: all within the same tool.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Development Process</h2>
    <p class="lead"><b><i>VISION</i></b> means you no longer have to code, verify syntax, compile debug, document, wash, rinse and repeat.</p>
    <p class="lead">Every step of the development process in <b><i>VISION</i></b>, from design to implementation to distribution, is done by connect parts together.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Re-inventing the Wheel</h2>
    <p class="lead">As you build out your software solutions in <b><i>VISION</i></b>, it only gets easier. The parts of your software that you have created can be turned into templates which can be re-used. There is no longer a need to re-invent the same things over and over again!</p>
    <p class="lead">With <b><i>VISION</i></b>, we have written an awesome framework which allows you to focus on your solutions and not our development platform.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">IT Education </h2>
    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">For Everyone</h2>
    <p class="lead">Learning to write software is really hard because students need to learn how to program and how to code at the same time. <b><i>VISION</i></b> solves this problem by allowing students to learn how to programming without having to learn how to code. This allows the student to focus on problem solving without having to learn the idiosyncrasies of programming languages and compilers.</p>
